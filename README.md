# Track the exact location of a mobile free
Our platform is based on GPS, and our servers are connected to the 27 earth-orbiting satellites. Each satellite is constantly sending out signals that contain information related to the location, and the time signal went out. With the subscriber identity module attached to your device, the GPS receiver can locate the satellites and calculate the distance to each. The collected data is then used to deduce the location of your smartphone. This operation works on the basis of a simple mathematical principle called trilateration and will define your numberâ€™s precise location helping you out to find your phone.<br>

ðŸ‘‰Number tracking is the process of locating a device using the number linked to it. When you purchase a phone and insert the SIM card, it automatically generates data.<br>
This card is constantly transmitting information to your operator, who can keep an eye on your activity. They can check your incoming and outgoing messages and calls, but also conduct a geolocation to know your approximate or exact location.<br>
